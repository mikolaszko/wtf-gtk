# Following tutorial series of [ToshioCP](https://github.com/ToshioCP/Gtk4-tutorial)

because finding anything about GTK4 with a working example is a miracle,
well, if you are using Python/Rust there are plenty but i want to use C :)

# Why even learn GTK4?

I wanted to build a gnome compliant Isometric Drawing Editor, which is called actually  
[ITE](https://github.com/mikolaszko/ite) but it turns out tooling is stopping me more then I'd like so yeah
